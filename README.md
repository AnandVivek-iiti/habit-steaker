About This Project
This project was developed as part of the GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) induction process at IIT Indore. It is a web-based application that showcases fundamental web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with localStorage for data persistence.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate interactive UI elements and basic state management in a web application. It includes features such as a list-based interface, user input handling, and data storage mechanisms.

This project is not a fully functional habit tracker but serves as a practice ground for frontend development concepts and problem-solving skills
